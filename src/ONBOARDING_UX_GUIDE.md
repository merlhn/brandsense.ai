}
```

## 🎨 Design System

### Onboarding Banner Styling

```css
Background: linear-gradient(to right, var(--primary)/5, var(--primary)/10)
Border: 1px solid var(--primary)/20
Padding: 24px
Border Radius: 8px
Backdrop Filter: blur(12px)

Animation: 
  - Initial: opacity 0, translateY -10px
  - Final: opacity 1, translateY 0
  - Duration: 200ms
  - Easing: ease-out
```

### Refresh Button Pulse Indicator

```css
Position: absolute top-right of button
Size: 12px × 12px
Background: var(--vercel-green)
Animation: 
  - Ping effect (expanding circle)
  - Opacity: 75%
  - Duration: 1s
  - Iteration: infinite
```

### Progress Dots (Processing State)

```css
3 dots, 6px × 6px each
Background: var(--primary)
Animation: pulse
Delay: 0ms, 150ms, 300ms (staggered)
```

---

## 💾 LocalStorage Persistence

### Onboarding Banner Dismissal

**Key:** `onboarding_banner_dismissed`  
**Value:** `"true"` (string)

**Set When:**
- User clicks X button to dismiss
- Data becomes "ready" (auto-dismiss after 2s)

**Reset When:**
- User logs out (storage.clearAll())
- Never resets on its own (user preference)

**Check Logic:**
```typescript
const [showOnboardingBanner, setShowOnboardingBanner] = useState(() => {
  const dismissed = localStorage.getItem('onboarding_banner_dismissed');
  return !dismissed; // Show if not dismissed
});
```

---

## 🔄 Data Status States

### State Machine

```
pending → processing → ready
   ↓          ↓          ↓
 error ←  error ←   error
```

### Visual Indicators by Status

| Status | Banner Message | Pulse Dot | Auto-Poll |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| `pending` | "Welcome! Click Refresh..." | ✅ Green | ❌ No |
| `processing` | "Processing... 2-3 min" | ✅ Green | ✅ Every 3s |
| `ready` | (Auto-dismiss) | ❌ Hidden | ❌ No |
| `error` | (Error message shown) | ❌ Hidden | ❌ No |

   - % users who successfully see data on first try

3. **Drop-off Points:**
